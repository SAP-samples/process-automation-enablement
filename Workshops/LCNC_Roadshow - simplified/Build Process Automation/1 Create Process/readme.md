## Details
You work in the finance department of the company and need to regularly process incoming scanned invoices.
This is actually causing a lot of manual effort in order to extract the data out of the pdf or image, send to the approval of the manager before the data would be actually entered into the system.
This needs to be automated since we are talking about multiple invoices which are coming every single day. Also we need to define the approval flow depending on the specific criteria (in this tutorial series, company is considered as criteria).

### You will learn
  - How to create a project and the related process
  - How to add a form to trigger this process
### About this Exercise

In this exercise you create a process which houses all the project files related to an automation, including bots, workflows, decisions and forms. As part of this, you will define a set of inputs that will define the location and information of the process trigger.

### Step 3: Define the Form to Start the Process

   When working with SAP Build Process Automation, processes can be triggered by a variety of ways such as an API, a form and schedules. In this example, we will build a form that a user will enter information into to trigger the process.

1. In the canvas
    - Select **+**
    - Select **Forms**
    - Select **New Form**.

    ![New Form](04.png)

2. Provide the following information and choose **Create**:

    |  Field Name     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Name          | **`Invoice Request Form`**
    |  Description    | **`Form to start the process`**


    > Note: Identifier will be filled automatically.

    In the form you have multiple layout and input elements.

    - Click on '...' next to the newly created form and open the Editor.

3. Create a headline, drag and drop **Headline 1** into the canvas.

4. Now, we will create the form layout the will be used to input the relevant information for the process:

    - Add a Headline 1 called: `Invoice Request Form`
    - Add a Paragraph: `Please provide the following details to start the process`

    ![Headline Name](07.png)
    ![Paragraph](08.png)

5. Now, let's add some input fields into the form that need to be set to required:

    |  Input Field Type  | Name | Settings
    |  :------------- | :------------- | :------------
    |    Text       |**`Employee Name`**| **Required**
    |    Text       |**`File Path`**| **Required**
    |      Date      |  **`Current Date`** | **Required**
