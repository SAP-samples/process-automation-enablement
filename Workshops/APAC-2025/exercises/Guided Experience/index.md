# Guided Experiences with SAP Build Process Automation and SAP Build Work Zone
## Introduction
**Guided experiences** are designed to simplify multi-step business processes by breaking them down into manageable and intuitive steps. Each step can be enriched with various types of content, including videos, documents, forms, tasks, UI cards, and apps to provide users with all the necessary information to complete each step. Steps can be classified as optional or mandatory, ensuring critical tasks are completed while allowing flexibility for other actions. 

Users don't need to worry about finishing all the steps at once as the progress is saved, enabling them to resume from where they left off. Guided experiences can be used for various complex processes such as parental leave, benefits enrolment, employee relocation, new hires onboarding or suppliers onboarding, training and enablement, and browsing and purchasing electronic equipment.

Now, letâ€™s start with modelling and deploying the guided process by following the instructions in [here](model.md).
