*üéâüéâ Congratulations!!! You have successfully created your first Guided Process! üéâüéâ*

### Model a Guided Process

Let's now model  our Guided Process in a structured and efficient manner. The step-by-step guide that follows will help you navigate each stage with clarity and ease.

1.	Click on the `+` icon located below the **Process Starts** step to open a drop-down menu. As shown in the image below, this menu provides various options, including *Stages, Subprocess and Controls & Events*, enabling you to structure and refine your Guided Process.

    ![Plus Button](./assets/SBPA_deployment/plusButton1.png)

2.	From drop-down menu, click on `Controls and Events`. Upon selection, two options will appear - `Branch` and `Wait for Duration` - allowing you to introduce to parallel execution or time-based delays within your guided process

    ![Controls and Events](./assets/SBPA_deployment/control&Events.png)

3.	Next, click on `Branch` to enable parallel execution within your guided process. This allows mutiple steps to run simulataneously on seprate branches, ensuring that different tasks can progress independently without any conditional dependencies.

    ![Add Branch](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addBranch.png)


##### Model a Stage with two sequential Steps

A **Stage** serves as a logical container that contain mutiple steps, which may be executed either parallelly or sequentially.

A **Step** represents a task within a **Stage** and can be enriched with various types of content, including videos, documents, forms, tasks, UI cards, and apps.

1.	Locate *Branch 1* and click the `+` icon. From the available options. Select `Stages` to define a logical container within your guided process.

    ![Add First Stage](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addFirstStage.png)

2.	Rename the stage as ‚Äú**Before Your First Day**‚Äù to represent tasks that need to be completed by the employee, before his/her first day.

    ![Name the Stage](./assets/SBPA_deployment/nameTheStage.png)

3.	Within the **Before Your First Day** stage, click `Add Step` button to incorporate a new step.

    ![Add Step](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addStep1.png)

4.	Upon clicking `Add Step`, a drop-down menu will appear, displaying **Widget**. Click on `Widget` as shown in below image. This will add a step in your stage.

    ![Add Widget](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addWidget1.png)

5.	Name the step as ‚Äú**Accept Offer letter**‚Äù to clearly define its purpose within the guided process. Next, click `Required Step` checkbox to mark this step as mandatory. A *Required Step* cannot be skipped and must be completed before proceeding further. If the *Required Step* checkbox is left unchecked, the step remains optional and can be  bypassed. 

    ![Name Accept Offer Letter Step](./assets/SBPA_deployment/nameAcceptofferLetterStep.png)


*üéâüéâ Congratulation!!! You have successfully created a mandatory step within a stage! üéâüéâ*

##### Model a sequential step in "Before Your First Day" stage

1.	To add another step in sequence to the **Accept Offer Letter** step, click the `+` icon located directly below it. Upon clicking, drop-down menu will appear.

    ![Add Sequential Step](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addSequentialStep.png)

2. From the drop-down menu, click on `Widget` to add a new step to your stage.

    ![Add Widget](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addWidget2.png)

3.	The newly added step is sequential to **Accept Offer Letter**. Name the step as **Vaccination Details** to define it's purpose within guided process. Then, check the `Required Step` checkbox to mark it as mandatory.

    ![Details of Second Step](./assets/SBPA_deployment/detailsOfSecondStep.png)

At this stage, you have successfully created a **stage** containing **two mandatory steps** arranged in *sequential order*.

##### Integrate an existing Process

1. Locate *Branch 2* and click `+` icon below it. This will open a drop-down menu with three options: *Stages*, *Subprocess* and *Controls & Events*.

    ![Plus Icon for Process](./assets/SBPA_deployment/plusIconForProcess.png)

2.	To proceed with adding a dependency process, select `Subprocess` from the menu. This will allow you to integrate the existing process as a step within your guided process.

    ![Add Process](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addProcess.png)

3.	Select the process titled `Fetch Hire Date` to integrate it within your guided process.

    ![Add Dependent Process](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addDependentProcess.png)

##### Configure a "Wait for Duration"

**"Wait for Duration"** step introduces a pause in the guided process, requiring a specific date to be elapsed before the process can proceed further. This ensures that execution resumes only after the defined waiting period has elapsed.

1. Click the `+` icon located just above **Stage 1**. This will open a drop-down menu. Select **Controls and Events** where you see two options: *Branch, Wait for Duration*.

    ![Select plus icon](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addControl&Events.png)

2. From the available options, Select `Wait for Duration` to introduce a waiting period in the guided process.

    ![Add Wait for Duration](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addWaitForDuration.png)

3. Once **Wait for duration** is added to the guided process. Click on ‚Äú`Select Item`‚Äù under the *Time Duration* section. This opens the **Process Content** panel beside it, displaying **Fetch Hire Date** step‚Äôs output as Hiring Date.

    ![Map Reference Date](./assets/SBPA_deployment/mapReferenceDate.png)

4. Click on `Hiring Date` within the **Process Content** panel. This will automatically populate the textfield with the *Fetch Hire Date* process's **Hiring Date**.

    ![Set Hiring Date](./assets/SBPA_deployment/setHiringDate.png)

##### Model a Stage with two parallel Steps

1.	Click on `Stage 1` to begin configuring it. Rename the stage as ‚Äú**On First Day**‚Äù to represent tasks that need to be completed by the employee, on his/her first day.

    ![First Day Stage](./assets/SBPA_deployment/firstDayStep.png)

2.	Click on `Add Step` within the **On First Day** stage. From the drop-down menu, select `Widget` to define a new step within the stage.

    ![Add Step](./assets/SBPA_deployment/addStep3.png)

3.	Name the step as ‚Äú**Collect your laptop and ID Card**‚Äù to specify its purpose. Then, check the `Required Step` checkbox to ensure that this step must be completed in order to complete the stage.

    ![Collect your laptop and ID Card Details](./assets/SBPA_deployment/step3Details.png)

4.	Click the `+` icon located to the right of the **Collect your laptop and ID Card** step. This will create a new step that runs parallel to the **Collect your laptop and ID Card** step, inside the stage **On First Day**.

    ![Parallel Step](./assets/SBPA_deployment/parallelStep.png)

5.	Upon clicking the `+` icon, a drop down menu will appear. Select `Widget` from the menu to add a new step. Name the newly added step ‚Äú**Meet the team and hiring manager**‚Äù to define its purpose. This time, donot check the `Required Step` checkbox. As a result the stage can be completed even if this step is not performed.

    ![Step 4 Details](./assets/SBPA_deployment/step4Details.png)

[NOTE]: ‚Äú**Collect your laptop and ID Card**‚Äù and ‚Äú**Meet the team and hiring manager**‚Äù steps are *parallel* within stage **"On First Day"**. It means you can work on both steps simultaneously.

*üéâüéâ Congratualtions!!! You have successfully modeled your first guided process! üéâüéâ*

### Release and Deploy the Project having Guided Process

To ensure your guided process is ready for execution, you need to *Save*, *Release* and *Deploy* it into the target environment. This section provided a structural approach in finalizing and making your process operational.

1.	First, click on `Save` to ensure all changes to the guided process are stored. Once saved, click on `Release` to release the project and making it ready for deployment.
