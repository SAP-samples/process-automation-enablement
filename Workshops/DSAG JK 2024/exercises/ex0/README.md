&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;  
1.	Go to the Process Builder and add the **Auto Approval Notification** form to the **Default** node.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA59.png)

&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA39.png)    
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
       This completes the process design with condition criteria that will decide what process flow is executed and whether there will be an auto-approval or a one-step approval route.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
## Release business process project
&nbsp;  
To run the process you have to first release and then deploy the business process project.
&nbsp;  
Releasing a project creates a version or snapshot of the changes and deploying the project makes it available in runtime to be consumed. You can only deploy a released version of the project, and at a given time there can be multiple deployed versions of the same project.
&nbsp;  
1.	In the Process Builder, to release a project, click **Release** button on the top-right corner of the screen and provide a description in the popup dialog.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA40.png)   
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
      If you are releasing for the first time, then the version will start with **1.0.0.** Next time you release, the version numbers will be automatically updated.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
2.	Click **Release**.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA41.png)   
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
## Deploy released project
&nbsp;  
1.	Once the project is released successfully, Click **Deploy** button on the top-right corner of the screen.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA42.png)   
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
2.	Select the **Public** environment and click **Deploy**.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA43.png)   
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
3.	Click **Deploy**
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA44.png)   
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
       Deployment will take a couple of seconds/minutes depending upon how big your project is and how many different artifacts it has. 
       Any errors during the deployment will be shown in the Design Console at the bottom of the screen.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
4.	Once the deployment is successful, you will see a changed status.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA45.png)   
&nbsp;  
      You cannot edit released or deployed projects. 
      To continue working on your project, you need to select the Editable version of your project (at the top of the page).
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
## Publish to the SAP Build Library
&nbsp;  
1.	After you released and deployed the process, go to SAP Build Lobby and find your project (i.e. Sales Orders Management AC099201U**XX**).
&nbsp;  
2.	Click on the 3 dots under options and **Publish to Library**.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA46.png) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
 3.	Select the version (you can select the most recent version) and click on Publish.  
        Now, your process will be visible from SAP Build Apps in SAP Build Library section.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA47.png) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
You have successfully released, deployed and published your process. It is time to run the process and see the results.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## Run business process
&nbsp;  
1.	Letâ€™s test the API Trigger in the **Monitoring** tab of the SAP Build Lobby.
      - Click on the **Manage > Process and Workflows** tile.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA48.png) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
2.	Search for AC099201U**XX** to display your project.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA49.png) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
3.	Click on **Start New Instance**.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA50.png) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
4.	Remove the example payload in the dialog. Use the following JSON in the dialog.
 ```
      {
            "salesorderdetails": 
            {
            "distributionChannel": "10",
            "expectedDeliveryDate":"2024-02-25",
            "material": "MZ-FG-S200",
            "quantity":11,
            "salesOrderType":"OR",
            "salesOrganisation":"1710",
            "shipToParty":"SAP",
            "soldToParty":"1000292"
             }
      }
 ```
 &nbsp;  
The quantity must be entered as a number (no quotes) and dates must be entered in the format above for the expected delivery date.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Click **Start New Instance and Close**.    
&nbsp;  
![Main](assets/SPA51.png) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Donâ€™t modify the payload when you integrate with SAP Build Apps.
&nbsp;  
You did successfully run your project. It is time to monitor the process flow and access the tasks.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## Monitoring the process flow
&nbsp;  
Monitoring business process is one of the key aspect of the automated processes. Technical monitoring is an administrator job where a process admin proactively and consistently monitors the process performance, identifies any issues in the process and takes necessary actions to ensure business process continuity.
&nbsp;  
**SAP Build** provides different applications to monitor and manage different process artifacts. These applications are available under the **Monitor** tab.
&nbsp;  
1.	Earlier, we accessed **Processes and Workflows** under the **Manage** section to see all the deployed processes.
&nbsp;  
	To monitor all the running instances of the process, you must go to **Process and Workflow Instances** under the **Monitor** section.
&nbsp;  
	 
       ![Main](assets/SPA52.png) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
       In there, you will see all the running, erroneous and suspended process instances. 
       Use the filter bar to get a more customized view of the process instances based on different statutes like running, completed, suspended, terminated and so forth.
&nbsp;  
	The best way to find your process is to search for your user number or initials, depending on how you named it.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
2.	Search for the project **Sales Orders Management AC099201UXX** using the Project dropdown. All the instances of the selected project is displayed in the table below. Select the latest one as it was the one created in the previous lesson.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA53.png) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
       Explore different process monitoring options. Observe the process instance information, process context which is the actual process data flowing across different activities in the process and the execution logs where you can see entire trace of how the process has been progressing with some basic runtime information of each activity.
&nbsp;  
	Since the quantity is greater 10, the process requires an approval. You can check the Logs and Context for this instance.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA54.png) 	
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
3.	As you can see the process is waiting for the task to be completed. These tasks are generated from the forms that are added in the process and can be accessed via the **My Inbox** application. Click on the icon on the top right corner to open the **My Inbox** applicaiton.	
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA55.png) 	
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
## Accessing the tasks
&nbsp;  
1.	Tasks are the request for the users to participate in an approval or review process. These tasks appear in the **My Inbox** application shipped with **SAP Build**. Users can claim, approve and reject the task from their inbox. You can add a message to the buyer.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
2.	Click **Approve**.
&nbsp;  
       ![Main](assets/SPA56.png) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
3.	Once you **Approve/Reject** the order, **refresh** the inbox again to get the notification of Order Confirmation with the created sales order in the system.
&nbsp;  
	Click on **Submit** to acknowledge the order and complete the process.
&nbsp;  	 
       ![Main](assets/SPA57.png) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
4.	Once you acknowledge the notification sent via the approval process, the process will be completed. The Logs can be seen in the **Monitor** section.
&nbsp;
