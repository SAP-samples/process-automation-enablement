# HT006 Create your First Low-Code App & Automation with SAP Build

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP d-com Hands-On session **HT006 Create your First Low-Code App & Automation with SAP Build.** 

## Prerequisite

- None for sure

## Overview

Whether you're a business expert, a key user, or a developer, get inspired and experience low-code app development and automation with SAP Build.   
**See SAP Build in action, end to end!**  
Create a sales order process in SAP Build Process Automation, then create an app for entering the sales order data and triggering the process with SAP Build Apps, and put it all together in your own digital workspace for sales order management using SAP Build Work Zone.  
The goal is to demonstrate not only the scope and flexibility of each individual SAP Build tool, but also to highlight the ease and power of integration between the Build tools and S/4HANA Cloud.  
Please note that we have reduced the content of this E2E scenario https://developers.sap.com/mission.build-workshop-sales-order.html to allow for a **1 hour d-com experience**.  

## Testsystem
