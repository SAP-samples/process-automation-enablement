# Purchase Order Approval - Process Variants

In this exercise, we will learn how to create different Process Variants for the Purchase Order Approval Process in :<br>

1. Variant Template Editor - Template developer is usually a pro developer and creates the variant template, the default variant.<br>

2. Variant Management Editor - Variant user - usually a business configuration expert - accesses the variant management editor from the tile in your SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition site and creates and defines the order of the variants<br>

## Create Process Variant Template 

1. Click on "Purchase Requisition Process" an open <br>
2. Click on + after "Determine Approver" and choose Variant Template 
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/PV_Create.png)
3. Give name as "Purchase Order Variant Template" and Save <br>
4. Click on "Open Variant Template"<br>
5. Click on "Add Steps" and add all the available steps.
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Add_Steps.png) 
6. Steps available in Variant Editor will look as below:
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Available_Steps.png)
7.Click on "Add Default Variant" in the General tab and Create a new one with name "Default Variant" which will act as a fallback if no other variant is created or no other start condition is met
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Default_Variant.png)
8.Click on + after the Process and add Variant Steps to Default Variant
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Add_Default_Variant.png)
9.Add Department Approval Process step to the Default Variant
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Add_Dept_Default_Variant.png)
10.Click on + after the Process , click on Controls and Events and add Branch called "Parallel Branch" to Default Variant
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Add_Parallel_Branch.png),
<br>Parallel branches are created so that 2 or more steps can execute simlataneously without waiting for the previous step to compelete. But all the parallel branches have to be completed before next step can proceed though.<br>
11.Add Steps Finance Approval Process and Legal Department Approval Process as parallel branches
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Add_Fin_Legal_Parallel_Branch.png)
12.Click on + and Add Step Procurement Approval Process. Default Variant finally will look like below:
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Final_Default_Variant.png)
13.Save the Default Variant<br>
14.Click on Variables tab and add attributes
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Add_Variables.png)
15.Add all the attributes from the process context
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Add_Attributes.png)
    1. ApprovalStatus<br>
    2. Totalprice<br>
    3. Approver<br>
    4. Company<br>
    5. DeliveryAddress<br>
    6. DeliveryDate<br>
    7. Department<br>
    8. PaymentTerms<br>
    9. RequestedBy<br>
    10. Supplier<br>
16.Create 2 Global outcomes, one for approved status and one for rejected status. Global outcomes are the overall outcome of a process variant<br>
17.Create a global outcome if overall approval status of all the steps in the variant is "Approved"  <br>
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Approved_outcome.png)<br>
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Approved_outcome_condition.png)<br>
18.Create another global outcome if overall approval status of all the steps in the variant is "Rejected"  <br>
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Rejected_Outcome.png)<br>
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Rejected_Outcome_Condition.png)<br>
19.Now,2 global outcomes depending on the approval status(Approved,Rejected) as condition are created
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Global_Outcomes.png)
        
## Create Process Variant Management

1.Release "Purchase Order Approval Process" project
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Release_Project.png)
2.Go to Lobby and choose the latest released version of the project "Purchase Order Approval Process.<br>
3.Do a Publish  to Library of the project so that it can be added as dependency to the Variant Management project which we will be creating now
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Publish_To_Library.png)
4.Create a Process Automation project in lobby named "Purchase Order Approval - Process Variants"
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Create_SBPA_Project.png)
5.Click and go inside the project.<br>
6.Add Business Process Project Dependency to "Purchase Order Approval Process" by going to Settings->Dependencies->Add a Business Process Project Dependency->Project.

  Add 2 levels of approvals, "Department Approval Process" and "Procurement Approval Process"
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Add_2_levels.png)
11.Create a variant named "Three level approvals" by clicking on Create Variant <br>
Add 3 levels of approvals, "Department Approval Process", "Finance Approval Process" and "Procurement Approval Process"

14.Order/Priority is changed now. "Three levels of approvals" moves to the top.
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Order_Change.png)

16.Activate the variant back by clicking on three dots (...) at the end of variant "Two level approvals" and click on Activate. Status of the variant becomes valid again. 
<br>![](/Workshops/BTPInnovation_Day/BTP_Innovation_Day_2025/exercises/ex1/images/Activate_Variant.png)
17.A variant can be deleted as well by clicking on "Delete".<br>
